Do you know about the Fairy Inkcap ?<!--more--> 
## Coprinellus disseminatus, the Fairy Inkcap
A fungus, Coprinellus disseminatus, the Fairy Inkcap, also known as Fairies Bonnet, Trooping Inkcaps, and Trooping Crumble Cap. The species was given its current name in 1939 by Jakob Emanuel Lange. This mushroom is cosmopolitan in distribution and extremely delicate in nature. Also, it is saprobic and usually appears in very large trooping groups on rotten wood. It can be seen from August to November. Because of its fragility, people do not prefer to consume this wild mushroom even though it is edible and non-poisonous.

### Classification:
- **Phylum:** Basidiomycota
- **Class:** Agaricomycetes
- **Order:** Agaricales
- **Family:** Psathyrellaceae

Its body has a cap, gills, and stem. At a young stage, the caps are egg-shaped and pale or purely white in colour. Then it expands to bell-shaped and turns grey, which takes just two or three days, and then it begins blackening. The gills contain spores which turn from white to grey and then to black when spores get matured. The stem is thin, hollow, white in colour, and fragile.
