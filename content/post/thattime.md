Last time we talked, <!--more--> 
you told me you moved on..  
even though we weren’t together  
that time, I wasn’t gone…

What news will you tell me  
if we talk again??  
your marriage or anniversary??  
I am afraid of pain..

No matter how badly  
I want to talk with you…  
my fear of getting hurt  
never lets me do…

I know we won’t meet although  
we live in this same world!  
because now we have become parallel forever….

Last time we talked,  
you were seeing someone..  
even though we weren’t together  
that time, I wasn’t gone…
