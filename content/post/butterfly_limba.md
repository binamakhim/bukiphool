I am a student who has completed Bachelor Degree in Zoology and Chemistry.Being a student of science background,I am inquisitive and interested in collecting photographs of different species of butterflies.It gives me pleasure and wisdom recognizing different species of butterflies in my surroundings.The curiosity was ignited at the end of the first lockdown.I had gone to my hometown and had captured some beautiful photographs of different butterflies.It slowly developed into my new hobby and I discovered myself as a butterfly lover.In this blog,I will include some pictures of different species of butterflies that I managed to capture at my hometown.    

My hometown Limba is located in Miklajung mucipality,Panchthar district of province-1, eastern Nepal.It lies at an elevation of 1790 m above the sea level.Most of the butterflies were photographed in the months of  September,October and November 2020 ,while other from October 2021 and some were in April,May and October 2022.
