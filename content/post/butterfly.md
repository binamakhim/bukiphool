Godavari Botanical Garden is one of the finest places for an outing inside the Kathmandu valley. The visit helps to refresh your mind and vivify your knowledge about flora and fauna. <!--more--> If you are interested in nature, especially in plant species and insect kingdoms, you will not be disappointed. It is located at the

 base of Mount Phulchowki. The garden has been in existence for over 55 years and is one of Nepalâ€™s oldest botanical gardens. The garden has a wide variety of plants, including orchids, ferns, and cacti, and a beautiful collection of butterflies.

Godavari is a heaven for those who love watching butterflies. Godavari and its surroundings are considered a butterfly hotspot, home to over 300 species of butterflies, including some of the rarest and most beautiful ones. The best time to visit Godavari for butterfly watching is from March to September when the butterflies are most active.

The Godavari area is also home to various bird species, making it a paradise for bird watchers. Besides its natural beauty, Godavari is also a culturally significant place. It is home to the Godavari Kunda, a sacred pond that is believed to be the source of the Godavari River. The pond is surrounded by several temples and shrines, making it a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus.

I have visited Godavari several times, and every time, I am captivated by the beauty of the butterflies. Here are some of the butterfly species I encountered during my visit:

- Peacock Pansy (Junonia almana)
- Common Leopard (Phalanta phalantha)
- Striped Tiger (Danaus genutia)
- Common Jezebel (Delias eucharis)
- Common Crow (Euploea core)
- Lime Butterfly (Papilio demoleus)
- Common Emigrant (Catopsilia pomona)
- Tawny Coster (Acraea terpsichore)
- Common Grass Yellow (Eurema hecabe)
- Chocolate Pansy (Junonia iphita)
- Great Eggfly (Hypolimnas bolina)
- Common Bluebottle (Graphium sarpedon)
- Common Mormon (Papilio polytes)

If you love butterflies, I strongly recommend you visit the Godavari Botanical Garden. It's a place where you can lose yourself in the beauty of nature and forget about the worries of the world.
