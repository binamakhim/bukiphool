Many people often get confused between moths and butterflies.

## My Moth collection
Moths are insects of the lepidoptera order which look like butterflies. Many people often get confused between moths and butterflies. Moths are usually nocturnal (some species are day-flying) whilst most butterflies are diurnal. Moths have feathery antennae and unclubbed ends, while butterflies have slender antennae and clubbed ends. Moths are mostly dull and mundane-colored, whereas butterflies are bright in colour. In Nepal, the studies and research of moths have not been much significant. Only 129 species (according to Wikipedia) are listed.

In this blog, I am going to list out the photos of those moths which I captured when I was in my hometown Miklajung-7, Limba, Panchthar district, East Nepal. It lies at an elevation of 1790m high from sea level.

Some of the species are not identified and may be misidentified. This is because the sources were not sufficient, and my knowledge on this subject is not enough. I am still learning and exploring, and I will be very grateful for your corrections, advice, and comments. Keep loving, keep supporting. Thank you!
