Many people often get confused between moths and butterflies.

## My Moth collection
Moths are insects of the lepidoptera order which look like butterflies. Many people often get confused between moths and butterflies. Moths are usually nocturnal (some species are day-flying) whilst most butterflies are diurnal. Moths have feathery antennae and unclubbed ends, while butterflies have slender antennae and clubbed ends. Moths are mostly dull and mundane-colored, whereas butterflies are bright in colour. In Nepal, the studies and research of moths have not been much significant. Only 129 species (according to Wikipedia) are listed.

In this blog, I am going to list out the photos of those moths which I captured when I was in my hometown Miklajung-7, Limba, Panchthar district, East Nepal. It lies at an elevation of 1790m high from sea level.

### List of moths:
- Lebeda nobilis, commonly known as the tea-oil caterpillar moth
- The blood-vein (Timandra comae)
- The Brown-striped semilooper, (Mocis undata)
- Spoladea recurvalis, sometimes known by the common name Beet Webworm Moth or Hawaiian Beet Webworm
- Ambiguous Moth (Lascoria ambigualis)
- Genus Herpetogramma
- Creatonotos transiens, Clouded Tiger Moth
- Chiasmia fidoniata
- Genus Ataboruza
- Genus Sarbine
- Nyctemera adversata, Marbled White Moth
- Artona hainana
- Episteme adulatrix, Blue-spotted Forester Moth
- Genus Dasychira
- Genus Prorifrons
- Genus Berta
- Problepsis albidior
- Ethmia clytodoxa
- Dichromia orosia
- Cleora alienaria
- Erebus caprimulgus
- Genus Sphrageidus
- Geometer moths
- Genus Euricania
- Genus Amata
- Genus Maruca
- Genus Gazalina

Some of the species are not identified and may be misidentified. This is because the sources were not sufficient, and my knowledge on this subject is not enough. I am still learning and exploring, and I will be very grateful for your corrections, advice, and comments. Keep loving, keep supporting. Thank you!
